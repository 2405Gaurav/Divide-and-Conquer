## 🎯 Inngest Automation

The app leverages **Inngest** for reliable, serverless background jobs:

```javascript
// Example: Monthly Spending Insights
export const spendingInsights = inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "Generate Spending Insights" },
  { cron: "0 8 1 * *" }, // 1st of every month at 08:00
  async ({ step }) => {
    // Pull users with expenses this month
    // Generate detailed insights
    // Send notifications
  }
);
```

**Automated Jobs:**
- 📈 Weekly spending analysis
- 📊 Monthly report generation
- 🔔 Payment reminders
- 📧 Notification delivery

Convex provides a real-time database with built-in authentication and instant reactivity:

**Key Collections:**
- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `expenses` - All expense records with metadata
- `groups` - Shared expense groups
- `settlements` - Payment settlement history
- `reminders` - Scheduled reminders
- `notifications` - User notifications

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Real-time synchronization
- 🔐 Built-in permission system
- 📱 Optimized for mobile apps
- 🚀 Serverless functions included
